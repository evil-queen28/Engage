Student Attendance Management System Project

Step 1: Student Pannel
All student related data is filled and it gets stores in data base. We can update delete aur reset the data of student. The photos  of student is taken for 100 times for proper identification

Step 2: Train Data Pannel
In this pannel, the photos of student get trained

Step 3:Face Detector
This pannel is used for identification of student. If student gets identified ,it gives the student related data such as department, Roll no. and name of the student

Step 4:Attendance
